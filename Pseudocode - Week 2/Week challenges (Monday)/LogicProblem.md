# The teacher asks his 5 students if they studied mathematics yesterday.

## Alice: "Nobody studied math yesterday".
## Bob: "1 person studied math yesterday".
## Charlie: "2 people studied math yesterday".
## Dan: "3 people studied mathematics yesterday".
## Eva: "4 people studied mathematics yesterday".

## The teacher knows that only those who studied would be telling the truth and those who didn't would be lying. Who is telling the truth?

# Solution:
## La única posible respuesta para mi, es que Bob sea el que esta diciendo la verdad, pues es el único que estaría diciendo la verdad ya que el sabe realmente que el estudio.
